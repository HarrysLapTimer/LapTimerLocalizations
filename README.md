# LapTimerLocalizations
This repository contains all localizations for Harry's LapTimer and other apps.

Contents of this project will go into our app's builds regularly. Please feel free to
correct existing translations or add new languages. Details on the structure and format 
of files are available from UILocalization.pdf, it is mandatory to read this file before 
changing files.

<b>How to work on translations?</b>

Files described in UILocalization.pdf can be changed and updated individually. They can
be found in the language specific folder (<lang>.)


<b>How to work on translations?</b>

Files described in UILocalization.pdf can be changed and updated individually. They can be found in the language specific folder (<lang>.lproj). To allow the use of Linguan (MacOSX application) a Xcode project file is provided in addition
(LapTimerLocalizations.xcodeproj). To work with Linguan, fork and clone the repository. Once cloned, open LapTimerLocalizations.xcodeproj with Linguan and all .strings files will be presented with localizations side by side.

As described in UILocalization.pdf, keys in .strings files are mostly the English localization. In case a mapping for a key is missing in e.g. en.lproj/Localizable.strings, the app will use the key as the localized value. 

In case you have questions, please contact me by mail (Harry@gps-laptimer.de).

Thanks a lot for your support making Harry's apps the ultimate track solution!
